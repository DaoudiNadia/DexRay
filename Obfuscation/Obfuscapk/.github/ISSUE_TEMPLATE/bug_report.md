### Prerequisites

Before opening this issue, I tried the following steps:

<!-- Please put an x between the brackets of each line that applies below, so that [ ] becomes [x] (without leaving spaces around the x) -->

* [ ] Installed the tool in a way [described in the readme](https://github.com/ClaudiuGeorgiu/Obfuscapk#-installation) and ran `python3 -m obfuscapk.cli --help` without any errors

* [ ] Ran the tool using only `Rebuild`, `NewSignature` and `NewAlignment` obfuscators to verify that the app is not using anti-repackaging techniques

* [ ] Ran the tool using `--ignore-libs` flag to exclude third party libraries from the obfuscation

* [ ] Checked [FAQ](https://github.com/ClaudiuGeorgiu/Obfuscapk/blob/master/FAQ.md) and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/ClaudiuGeorgiu/Obfuscapk/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

* [ ] Checked for [existing similar issues on GitHub](https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+repo%3AClaudiuGeorgiu/Obfuscapk)
